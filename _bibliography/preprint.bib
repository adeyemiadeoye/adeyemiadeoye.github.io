  abstract={We propose an inexact proximal augmented Lagrangian method (P-ALM) for solving nonconvex structured optimization problems. The proposed method features an easily implementable rule not only for updating the penalty parameters, but also for adaptively tuning the proximal term. It allows the penalty parameter to grow rapidly in the early stages to speed up progress, while ameliorating the issue of ill-conditioning in later iterations, a well-known drawback of the traditional approach of linearly increasing the penalty parameters. A key element in our analysis lies in the observation that the augmented Lagrangian can be controlled effectively along the iterates, provided an initial feasible point is available. Our analysis, while simple, provides a new theoretical perspective about P-ALM and, as a by-product, results in similar convergence properties for its non-proximal variant, the classical augmented Lagrangian method (ALM). Numerical experiments, including convex and nonconvex problem instances, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  title={{Self-concordant Smoothing for Large-Scale Convex Composite Optimization}},
  author={Adeoye, Adeyemi D and Bemporad, Alberto},
  abstract={We introduce a notion of self-concordant smoothing for minimizing the sum of two convex functions, one of which is smooth and the other may be nonsmooth. The key highlight of our approach is in a natural property of the resulting problem's structure which provides us with a variable-metric selection method and a step-length selection rule particularly suitable for proximal Newton-type algorithms. In addition, we efficiently handle specific structures promoted by the nonsmooth function, such as l1-regularization and group-lasso penalties. We prove the convergence of two resulting algorithms: Prox-N-SCORE, a proximal Newton algorithm and Prox-GGN-SCORE, a proximal generalized Gauss-Newton algorithm. The Prox-GGN-SCORE algorithm highlights an important approximation procedure which helps to significantly reduce most of the computational overhead associated with the inverse Hessian. This approximation is essentially useful for overparameterized machine learning models and in the mini-batch settings. Numerical examples on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our approach and its superiority over existing approaches. A Julia package implementing the proposed algorithms is available at https://github.com/adeyemiadeoye/SelfConcordantSmoothOptimization.jl.},

  title={{Regularized Gauss-Newton for Optimizing Overparameterized Neural Networks}},
  author={Adeoye, Adeyemi D and Petersen, Philipp Christian and Bemporad, Alberto},
  abstract={The generalized Gauss-Newton (GGN) optimization method incorporates curvature estimates into its solution steps, and provides a good approximation to the Newton method for large-scale optimization problems. GGN has been found particularly interesting for practical training of deep neural networks, not only for its impressive convergence speed, but also for its close relation with neural tangent kernel regression, which is central to recent studies that aim to understand the optimization and generalization properties of neural networks. This work studies a GGN method for optimizing a two-layer neural network with explicit regularization. In particular, we consider a class of generalized self-concordant (GSC) functions that provide smooth approximations to commonly-used penalty terms in the objective function of the optimization problem. This approach provides an adaptive learning rate selection technique that requires little to no tuning for optimal performance. We study the convergence of the two-layer neural network, considered to be overparameterized, in the optimization loop of the resulting GGN method for a given scaling of the network parameters. Our numerical experiments highlight specific aspects of GSC regularization that help to improve generalization of the optimized neural network. The code to reproduce the experimental results is available at https://github.com/adeyemiadeoye/ggn-score-nn.},
