  title={SC-Reg: Training Overparameterized Neural Networks under Self-Concordant Regularization},

  abstract={In this paper we propose the SC-Reg (self-concordant regularization) framework for learning overparameterized feedforward neural networks by incorporating second-order information in the Newton decrement framework for convex problems. We propose the generalized Gauss-Newton with Self-Concordant Regularization (SCoRe-GGN) algorithm that updates the network parameters each time it receives a new input batch. The proposed algorithm exploits the structure of the second-order information in the Hessian matrix, thereby reducing the training computational overhead. Although our current analysis considers only the convex case, numerical experiments show the efficiency of our method and its fast convergence under both convex and non-convex settings, which compare favorably against baseline first-order methods and a quasi-Newton method.},

  abstract={We present, via the solution of nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), a continuous-time formulation for stochastic optimization algorithms used for training deep neural networks. Using continuous-time formulation of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), relaxation approaches like the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method are interpreted as the solution of nonlinear PDEs that arise from modeling physical problems. We reinterpret, through homogenization of SDEs, the modified SGD algorithm as the solution of the viscous Burgers' equation that models a highway traffic flow.},

  title={Blood Flow in an Inclined Tapered Stenosed Porous Artery under the Influence of Magnetic Field and Heat Transfer},
  author={Adeoye, A. D.},
  institution={African Institue for Mathematical Sciences, Cameroon},
  abstract={A tapered inclined porous artery with stenosis was considered under the influence of magnetic field and heat transfer. The mathematical formulation for the momentum and energy equations of the blood flow considered to be Newtonian were obtained. The energy equation which was obtained by taking an extra factor of heat source and the nonlinear momentum equation were simplified under the assumption of mild stenosis. These equations were non-dimensionalized and solved using Differential Transform Method (DTM) to obtain expressions for velocity, temperature and volumetric flow rate. The graphs of the expressions were plotted against radius of the artery to simulate the effects of magnetic field, heat transfer and other fluid parameters on the velocity, temperature and the volumetric flow rate of the blood. It was observed that as the magnetic field parameter ($M$) increases, the velocity, temperature and the volumetric flow rate of the blood increase but wall shear stress decreases at the stenosis throat. It was further observed that the effects of heat transfer and magnetic field resulted into a greater variation in the volumetric flow of an inclined artery in the converging region than in the diverging region.},
