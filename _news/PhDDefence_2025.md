Successfully defended my PhD thesis titled "Quasi-Newton Methods for Solving Nonsmooth Optimization Problems in Learning and Control" at IMT Lucca, Italy, on June 3, 2025. The defence was well-received, and I am grateful for the support from my supervisor, committee, family, friends and colleagues.
