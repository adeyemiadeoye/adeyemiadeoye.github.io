Our paper, "An Inexact Sequential Quadratic Programming Method for Learning and Control of Recurrent Neural Networks" got accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS). This paper proposes a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) framework for recurrent learning in the first stage of training a recurrent control neural network (RCNN) which models and controls a complex dynamical system.
