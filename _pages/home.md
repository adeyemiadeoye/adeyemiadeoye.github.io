I am currently a Research Fellow in the Dynamical Systems, Control, and Optimization (<a href="https://dysco.imtlucca.it/" target="_blank">DYSCO</a>) group at IMT Lucca (Italy) working on an ERC Advanced Grant project led by <a href="http://cse.lab.imtlucca.it/~bemporad/" target="_blank">Prof. Alberto Bemporad</a>. My research focuses on mathematical optimization for engineering applications, spanning theoretical foundations, algorithm design, and practical implementations in machine learning, control systems, and interdisciplinary domains.
